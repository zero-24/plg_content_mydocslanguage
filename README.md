## Sponsoring and Donation

You want to support my work for the [development of my extensions](https://extensions.joomla.org/profile/profile/details/200189/) and my work for the [Joomla! Project](https://volunteers.joomla.org/joomlers/248-tobias-zulauf) you can give something back and sponsor me. 

There are two ways to support me right now:

- You just want to send me an one-time donation? Great you can do this via [PayPal.me/zero24](https://www.paypal.me/zero24).

Thanks for your support!
